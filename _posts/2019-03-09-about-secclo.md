**SECCLO**, or Security and Cloud Computing is a double degree programme organised by Erasmus Mundus foundation. The interested person could find needed information from various sources, official website, facebook page or Instagram account. However, I would like to share my personal genuine story about my experience.

# My top things to bear in mind
1. In technical major the majority of professors had a practical and industry acquaintance with their field by working in companies as researchers, founding a company or combining both. Through the whole academic year I rarely found lectures insipid.
2. I rarely faced a predilection toward exams here. Inversely, professors do not believe in accuracy of exams in representing the knowledge and skills of students. This means no exasperating worries about your grades.

# Best memories
1. Getting a Christmas letter from Santa Claus
2. Witnessing Aurora in the campus and constantly checking for appearance of Northern lights via applications.

# What did I find unusual about Scandinavian countries and people
1. Winters are serene, sulk and mournful with few hours of sunlight with snow flakes falling down nonchalantly, compared to shiny and blossoming streets lit with sunlight during the summer time. The winter might sometimes leave you listless.
2. Candour of local population, high level of trust and mere situation when slanderous information was told for interlocutor. At the first time the wrong impression can occur related to uncongeniality of Scandinavians. However, the intermingling of
3. Belittling the negative emotions, tiny discomfort (as lack of coffee) and nugatory worries
4. Unobtrusive manner of behavior and immensely respectful demeanor.
5. The perchance obtuse grammar in Finnish language and long words.
6. Buoyant and zestful attitude of society
